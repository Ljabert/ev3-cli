# Windows command line interface for LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3

This program gives you terminal access to the EV3 root shell.

Use the [EV3Basic](https://github.com/c0pperdragon/EV3Basic) editor to open the source file and hit the `Run` button to create a `EXE`-file and the `DLL`-files needed for execution.

After that you can always just run the `.exe` without having to open the editor, provided you keep the generated files.

To close the program simply write `exit` or close the terminal window.
